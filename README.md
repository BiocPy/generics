# bioc-generics

> Generics for core data structures across all classes in BiocPy

For now, I don't anticipate users utilizing this package directly. This is meant for developers who want to extend the functionality of BiocPy to support new data structures or experiments.

## Install

Package is published to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/bioc-generics/)

```shell
pip install bioc-generics
```
